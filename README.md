# Wave function collapse generator

This project is an implementation of the wave function collapse algorithm, which is a procedural content generation algorithm. It is designed to generate 2D tile maps based on a set of input tiles and their adjacency rules.

The algorithm is inspired by quantum mechanics, where the wave function represents the possible states of a system. In this case, the system is a grid of tiles, and the wave function collapse algorithm collapses the possible states into a single state based on the input constraints.

## Disclaimer

This project was also as a testcase for [Aider](https://aider.chat/)
